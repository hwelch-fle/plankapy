## Project Status

The goal of this project is to provide interfaces for as many Planka objects as possible. 

Currently implemented routes include:
- Project
- Board
- List
- Card
- Label
- Background
- User

Routes not yet implemented:
- Attachment
- Stopwatch
- Comment

This project is currently being very slowly developed with me mostly just merging in patches from the community. When Planka 2.0 is made public, I will likely branch this repo off and work on re-developing it for some of the new features.
