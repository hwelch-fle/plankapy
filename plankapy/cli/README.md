# Submodule for Plankapy CLI tools

## Proposals

### **`click`** : use @madduck's [`plankacli`](https://github.com/madduck/plankacli) repo as a starting point

#### Pros: Already exists

#### Cons: Written in `v1`, needs to be ported to `v2`

### **`argparse`** : use python's builtin `argparse` module

#### Pros: No additional dependencies

#### Cons: Not as simple to use as `click`
